# Portfolio Website | Bootstrap 4.4
## Description

To familiarise myself with the Bootstrap Framework, I recreated my portfolio website while limiting the use of media queries, and I decided to go with a dark aesthetic and a 'moody' design. In order to achieve this, I learned how to add a 'parallax' effect and a smoke animation. I included a couple hover effects to highlight several features, buttons, or links.

Summary:
 
* There is a navigation bar with a dropdown that allows you to access my portfolio projects and links to the appropriate sections
* A hero/jumbotron section highlighting my name and a compressed image
* Each project is described in the portfolio section using bootstrap cards and grid
* The skills I expect to learn are displayed with Iconify Icons
* Contact information is included in the same row as the about me section
* The contact section displays my socials with Font Awesome icons
* The footer is kept minimal to keep inlign with the design

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Users can access this website on smaller devices as I have used a reactive Bootstrap Grid. Furthermore, I have removed the background images and animations on mobiles to improve speed.

Below you can see my website on a mobile:
